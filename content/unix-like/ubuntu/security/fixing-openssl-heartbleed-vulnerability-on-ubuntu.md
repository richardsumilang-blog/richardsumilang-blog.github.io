The [Heartbleed bug][1] is a rather nice security vulnerability that allows
remote users to read memory without leaving a trace. Here are the steps to up
update Ubuntu to patch the issue.

**Note:** If you are running an OpenSSL bug built after April 7th 2014 then
you're in the clear. You can double check by running the command
`sudo openssl version -a`.

<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo reboot</code></pre>

**Protip:** You might also want to generate new SSH keys if you are saving
sensitive data on your servers.
