I'm very excited to announce [LosslessLife][1], a company focusing on the best
high resolution audio gear. LosslessLife reflects the continuous hard work
and commitment in the products it believes in by creating a voice to get the
word out from the audiophile communities and to consumers.

It is often assumed by the average consumer that a higher price and/or bigger
brand name results in better product. While this can be true to some degree,
consumers are often paying more for a product's marketing expenses when
purchasing from large retail stores rather than receiving higher performing
product.

Strict factors such as performance, output quality, and the overall
craftsmanship of products must be met in order to make it to LosslessLife as the
company name is synonymous with the highest level of quality.

In a market that is saturated with mediocre products, LosslessLife believes it's
success will be by educating consumers to make smarter choices when purchasing.
We do the research for you and provide [all of the facts][2] in an unbiased
fashion.

While many companies sell products which they claim they would use, LosslessLife
only sells products it does use by it's highly enthusiastic team with
backgrounds in technology, production, and an affinity for music.
