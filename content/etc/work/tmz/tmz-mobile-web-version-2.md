As the head developer of the TMZ mobile website, I'm pleased to announce
*Version 2*! It's been an exciting journey from start to finish. Take a look at
all the new features. I think you will like it.

### My role

I'm a full time developer at TMZ. I work on TMZ products such as the desktop
site and internal applications. My current focus is bringing the technologies up
to date with modern standards while enhancing the user experience on the mobile
website. In other words, creating a brand new product.


### It's more than just a pretty face

The new site provides a new fun and modern interface to interact with TMZ's
content. It borrows designs from our native mobile applications so you feel at
home; but they have been optimized for the mobile web browsing experience. It's
lighter, faster, and full of new features.

The inside has been built from the ground up. While I would like to write a
series of articles detailing the various technologies I chose to build the
application, I will say ECMAScript 6 proved itself suitable as the front-end
language and I can't wait to continue upgrading the application to ECMAScript 7,
ECMAScript 8, and so fourth as JavaScript continues to gain sanity.


## Show me the features!

The first thing you will notice is a fresh skin. It's clean, intuitive, and
brings the familiarity you would expect out of a mobile website. The large
images help you find the content you are looking for while continuing to load
more articles into the feed as you scroll, keeping your browsing experience
smooth.

### Navigation Menu

On the top left we have a menu button that pulls out a panel to allow navigation
to each section of the site. Starting from the top, you can find the "Got a tip?"
button where you can submit tips directly to TMZ. Following that we have each of
our site sections in big easily clickable buttons. Below that is a "Mobile
Alerts" button allowing you to register and receive mobile alerts sent directly
to your phone. The "TV Listings" displays TMZ show listings for your area. Or if
you're feeling like going on a tour then you can click the "TMZ Celebrity Tour"
and reserve a spot on the bus and tour hollywood. The "Login / Register" button
signs you into TMZ, allowing you to add your own comments to articles.

## Got A Tip?

Calling TMZ directly is still an option by clicking the "Give us a call" button.
The new section now supports sending TMZ a direct email via a web form with the
ability to upload files from your phone.

## News

The news contains tabs to help you sort the content in your preferred order. For
example, this feed defaults to the **Latest** articles and provides you the
options of sorting by most **Popular** and the most **Commented** trending
results. The **Popular** tab labels each article with a number for it's
popularity. The **Commented** section similarly labels each article with the
number of comments per article.

### Article Page

Clicking an article thumbnail brings you to a beautiful view of the article that
is easy to read. The cover is either an image, video, or gallery. You can tell
what the media type is because there is either a large play button for video or
gallery icon for galleries. You can click the primary media in the cover to load
the media right away or you can scroll down the article. As you scroll you will
notice buttons for sharing an article on your social networks and the comment
count next to the article details.

Within the article details there can be links to more related galleries, videos,
images, polls, and a number of other items (depending on what the content writer
chose to include).

Clicking on the comment bubble next to the article details, or the large comment
count below the article will show load all the comments. You may log in here
using one of many social network authentications (Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, etc)
to share your thoughts. If you are already logged into the mobile website with
your TMZ account then you can comment immediately. Closing the comment page will
bring you back to the article.

Below you will find other related articles that you may find interesting. The
want more section will display buttons to bios of celebrities mentioned in the
article and buttons to article categories that you also may find interesting.

At the end you will see a link to the next article from the feed you came from.
If you did not land on the article page coming from a feed then you will not see
this feature.

## Videos

Featuring *Latest Videos* by default, TMZ now provides access to videos by
*Category*. Each video also has it's own page where you can share the current
video with your social networks and find other related videos that you might be
interested in watching next.

## Photos

Like all the other feeds, bigger images and easier scrolling. The takeaway from
this section is the new thumbnail galleries that you can load by clicking on any
photo.

In the gallery, we use larger images to take up the whole viewport of your phone
to provide a richer experience. You can swipe your thumb on a photo to easily
navigate in the direction you want to go. There are also new sharing features
per photo and more gallery suggestions when reaching the end. I think you'll
like it.

## Sports

This feed is similar to the latest news feed but focuses on the *Sports*
category. You can also find sports articles while browsing other article feeds.
You will be able to easily identify a sports article by the green swipe on the
article.

## Celebs

Find the most trending celebrity by navigating to this feed section. This section
defaults to the most **Trending** celebrities and you can click on the **All**
tab to find a specific celebrity quicker. The **All** section loads smaller
thumbnails for faster scrolling.

### Celebrity Bio

Clicking on a celebrity will load up a detailed biography page where you can
find more information about a celebrity. Starting from the top, you can share the
celebrity information with your social network, read their bio, find photo
galleries, videos, and/or articles featuring the current celebrity bio you are
reading. We also show related celebrities that you may be interested in
reading about.

## Shows

Broken up into three sections, TMZ, TMZ Live, and TMZ Sports. You can come to
this section and watch live streaming (for TMZ Live), full episodes, and clips
for any of your favorite shows on your mobile device. You may also use the
button on the bottom of the page to find local TV listings for your area.

## Search

Can't find what you're looking for? Try out the new search feature. It uses an
updated backend service to provide you more accurate results than before. From
the search page you will be able to find celebrities, articles, videos, and
galleries. Celebrities will be listed first and the other page types will be
mixed in the results. You can identify each page type by the icons on the
results.

# Try it out for yourself!

This application is now live. You can access it on your mobile device by going to
http://www.tmz.com or directly to http://m.tmz.com. This mobile website is a
huge improvement over the previous implementation and I'm proud to have my name
stamped on the face of it. Many thanks to my awesome team for help making this
possible.
