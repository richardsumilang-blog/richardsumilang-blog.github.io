Today marks day 1 of my journey at [TMZ][1]. There is an exciting energy in
this environment. The first thing you notice is an open workspace where there is
action going on every minute. (You probably already know that if you've watched
the show before.) The technology is also very impressive. The team no doubt
consists of nothing but A+ players. How else would TMZ have gotten to be so big
in a short amount of time? I'm excited to bring my skills to the team and to see
what the future has to offer.
