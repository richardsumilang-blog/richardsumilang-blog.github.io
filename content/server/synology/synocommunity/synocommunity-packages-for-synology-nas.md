A great source for all sorts of packages such as Node.js, Zshell, BitTorrent
Sync, Redis, and Firefox Sync Server just to name a few. Check out the
[full list of packages][1] or just add the source to your package manager :)

1. Log into your NAS as administrator and go to Main **Menu → Package Center →
Settings → Package Sources.**
2. Click **Add**, type *SynoCommunity* as **Name** and
*<http://packages.synocommunity.com/>* as **Location** and then press **OK** to
validate.
3. Go back to the **Package Center** and enjoy SynoCommunity's packages in the
**Community** tab

See the [official site][2] for more info. Happy hacking!
