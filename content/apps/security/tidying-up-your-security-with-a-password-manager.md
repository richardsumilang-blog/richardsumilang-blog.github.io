Using a password manager adds numerous of security benefits. The key feature
being strong unique passwords for each application you use. Two of the most
popular password managers are [LastPass][1] and [1Password][2]. The main
difference is LastPass syncs to all your devices by storing your vault on their
servers. 1Password syncs to all your devices via Dropbox and does not save your
vault to any other servers. They are both good and whichever you choose to use
will be up to you.

After importing all your passwords to the password manager of your choice, you
should remove any traces of them from your browsers. Below are links to help you
do that for each browser.

- Firefox: [Viewing and deleting passwords.][3]
- Chrome: [Manage your website passwords.][4]
- Safari: [How to delete saved passwords in Safari.][5]

**Chrome: Uncheck "Offer to save your web passwords." in your Preferences to
have it stop asking.**

### Multifactor Authentication

It's a wise choice to enable a second authentication step to access your
account. This is especially helpful if you work on a shared computer or on a
company owned device. It not only helps you protect your accounts but your
company's as well. Read more about [LastPass multifactor options][6] and
